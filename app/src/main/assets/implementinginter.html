To declare a class that implements an interface, you include 
an implements clause in the class declaration. Your class can 
implement more than one interface, so the implements keyword 
is followed by a comma-separated list of the interfaces 
implemented by the class. By convention, the implements clause 
follows the extends clause, if there is one.
