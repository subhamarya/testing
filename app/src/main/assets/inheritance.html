Inheritance in java is a mechanism in which one object 
acquires all the properties and behaviors of parent object.
The idea behind inheritance in java is that you can create 
new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you 
inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and 
fields of parent class, and you can add new methods and fields 
also.
Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship, also known 
as parent-child relationship.
